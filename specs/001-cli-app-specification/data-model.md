# Data Model: Python CLI Application

## Key Entities

### Command
- **Description**: A user instruction that triggers specific functionality within the application
- **Fields**: 
  - name (string): The command identifier
  - arguments (list): Optional parameters for the command
  - handler (function): The function that processes the command
- **Validation rules**: 
  - Name must be a non-empty string
  - Arguments must be a list of strings
- **Relationships**: Commands are processed by the CommandProcessor

### Input
- **Description**: Text provided by the user through the terminal interface
- **Fields**:
  - raw_text (string): The original input from the user
  - command (Command): The parsed command object
  - is_valid (boolean): Whether the input is valid
- **Validation rules**:
  - Raw text must be a string
  - Command must be a valid command object
- **Relationships**: Input is processed to create a Command object

### Output
- **Description**: Text response generated by the application based on user input
- **Fields**:
  - message (string): The text to display to the user
  - status (string): Success, error, or info status
  - command_result (any): The result of command execution
- **Validation rules**:
  - Message must be a string
  - Status must be one of 'success', 'error', 'info'
- **Relationships**: Output is generated as a result of processing a Command

### Session
- **Description**: The period during which the application is running and accepting user commands
- **Fields**:
  - start_time (datetime): When the session started
  - is_active (boolean): Whether the session is currently active
  - history (list): List of commands executed in this session
- **Validation rules**:
  - Start time must be a valid datetime
  - Is active must be a boolean
- **Relationships**: Session contains multiple Input/Output pairs

## State Transitions

### Session States
- **Initialization**: Application starts, session begins
- **Active**: Waiting for user input, processing commands
- **Termination**: User exits, session ends gracefully

### Command States
- **Received**: Input received from user
- **Parsed**: Input converted to command object
- **Validated**: Command validated against rules
- **Executed**: Command handler executed
- **Completed**: Output generated and returned to user
